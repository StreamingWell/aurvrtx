Dear <%= @user.name %>,

Thank you for registering your interest in the Boehringer Ingelheim sponsored asthma webinar series.

This is a reminder that at 12.30 on Thursday 16th July Lauren Fensome will be presenting a webinar entitled:
The PRIMIS Asthma Care audit tool live demonstration

Lauren Fensome from PRIMIS will give an introduction to the PRIMIS asthma care audit tool, after which she will give a live demonstration on how to use the tool to the webinar attendees. This webinar will follow-on from the previous webinar in the series by Dr Mark Levy and Dr Carine Lewis, addressing National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) 2014 and the unmet need for treatments. This demonstration will also run through particular filters or searches in the PRIMIS tool relevant to clinical practice. This webinar will provide practical insight on the tool in order to help practices optimise management and care of patients.
This is the second in a series of three webinars. The subject of the next in the series will be "Inhaler education â€“ does it make a difference?"
This live webinar will last for 45 minutes where the first 30 minutes will be the presentation and the last 10 minutes will be an interactive Q&A session. Please note you will be able to submit your questions via the website during the live broadcast.
